How to use this tabula recta:

Visit http://brianfryer.1.ai/tabula-recta-generator/index.php

Print (at least) two copies of this page.
Keep one copy in your wallet, backpack, or purse, and the other copy next to your computer.
Come up with an algorithm (see examples below).
Reference your unique tabula recta when you need to create, or remember, a password.
Example 1:

Let's say you are creating a new account for Whoosh Traffic. Again, your password would begin at the intersection of column H and row O (the second and third letters of Whoosh Traffic).

From here, read off 12 characters diagonally. (See the green highlights below).

Example 2:

Or, perhaps you need to update your password for your Twitter account. In this case, your password would begin at the intersection of column W and row I (the second and third letters of Twitter).

From here, read off 12 characters diagonally. (See the yellow highlights below).

In the two examples above, the algorithm being used to determine where the password starts is:

[Second letter + Third letter of the name of the website] then [count off 12 characters diagonally, moving SW]

A few more algorithm examples:

[First letter + third letter of the name of the website] then [count off 16 characters in the same row moving left; if you reach the edge, begin again on the next row below].
[Last two letters of the name of the website] then [count off 14 characters in the same column moving up; if you reach the edge, begin again on the same row at the bottom]
Get creative; or, keep it simple. Either way, you'll never forget a password when using a tabula recta; and all your passwords will be unique, and secure!
